# Dimond Proxy

A Diamond Proxy Contract, also known as a "diamond," is a design pattern for Ethereum smart contracts introduced by Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 2535. The diamond pattern allows a contract to have an unlimited number of functions by separating the contract's functions into smaller contracts called "facets." The diamond acts as a proxy that routes function calls to the appropriate facets .


# Testing:
first we deploy diamond-Flattened code of diamond proxy
